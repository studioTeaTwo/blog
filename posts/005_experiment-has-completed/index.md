title: The experiment has completed
date: 2023-12-25
preview: Inspiration has taken shape, and learned a lot. The purpose has already been achieved. Currently, L402 server & LND is running it on the cheapest instance of GCE, but I'm having trouble constantly due to lack of machine resources around LND, so I need to rebuild it. But now not enough funds, I'll stop for a while until the server cost is worth it including bitcoin fee rate. You can see what this was experimenting with in the past articles and source code. The full article, including the paywalled part, can be viewed [on github](https://github.com/studioTeaTwo/self-sovereign-blog/tree/main/posts). However, if you would like a refund, please contact [me](https://njump.me/nprofile1qqsrtzdhjwuh038sy5t44lte9e79r5nw76pmgh9uvmzkcng544fcglspz4mhxue69uhhyetvv9ujuerpd46hxtnfduhszynhwden5te0wghxkmm2d9exztnfduhsz8thwden5te0dehhxarj9e3xjarrda5kuetj9eek7cmfv9kz7f8mutv). The thing to stop is only L402 related. This blog itself is still running (serverless is very reasonable) and I plan to write more articles in the future. Thank you for participating in this experiment! regards,
