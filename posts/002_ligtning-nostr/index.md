## It's time to evolve from apes

Last time this blog was able to implement [L402](https://github.com/lightning/blips/pull/26). But it was **incomplete**.
Entering the preimage manually is a problem. Nostr will be a solution.

addition: Sorry that these videos are large. If you cannot view it, please access again from a rich environment such as PC or Wi-Fi.

## AFTER:

I'll post an overview and technical details at a later date, though, you can right now experience it below. Of course, it is also able to prevent Nostr's private key from exposing using NIP-07.
